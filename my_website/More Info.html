<h1 center=allign>Soccer is one of my biggest passions. I started playing soccer when I was 3 years old. This is a picture of my competitive soccer team. I played for San Diego Soccer Club ever since I was 8 years old. My team has competed in many tournaments and was ranked 1st in Southern California and 3rd in the nation at one point. This is a picture of Hawaii. Hawaii is one of my favorite places to travel to. I have been there 5 times. RVCA is one of my favorite clothing brands. This is supposed to be a chalkboard showing math. Math is my favorite subject in school. Basketball is one of my favorite things to do. I do not play basketball competitively, I just play to have fun. This is a Rolex Submariner, I really like watches and I hope to get one like this in the future. I have a PC setup at home, not to this extent but it gets the job done. Nike is one of my favorite sporting brands. This is another Rolex that I want to get in the future. This was the flag of Iran before the revolution. My parents grew up in Iran and left at the time of the revolution. PacMan is one of my favorite games that I used to play as a kid. Nike Lunarglides are the running shoes that I like the most. They are very comfortable and reliable. Adidas is also one of my favorite sporting brands. This is a BMW i8. I really like BMW cars and I hope to own one in the future. This is an American Flag. I was born and raised in the USA.
